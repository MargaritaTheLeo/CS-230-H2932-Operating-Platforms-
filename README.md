# CS-230-H2932-Operating-Platforms-

The following software design document was created at the request of the company Creative Technology Solutions (CTS). This company recently took on a new client, The Gaming Room. The gaming Room developed a game called Draw it or Lose it, and this game is available only on Android platform. The goal of the company is to redesign the game in a way that it becomes suitable for multiple platforms in addition to Android. 

The purpose of this document was to provide an executive summary of the project, introduce the software design problem, identify design constraints, and present a solution. I believe that it was particularly important to identify specific needs of the client, and provide a solution tailored to those needs.

When developing the code for the program, it was critical to keep in mind that the designed game was supposed to be web-based and executable on multiple operating systems. Additionally, it was important to keep in mind the identified design constraints. Finally, it was necessary to remember about secure coding practices that would protect users’ personal information. 

If I could choose one part of this document to revise, I would take a deeper dive into considering client’s needs and into developing a broader set of design constraints. The reason for this is that at the end of the day, if the client is not happy with the product, the project cannot be considered successful. Application development must be client-centered, and client’s needs must be prioritized. 

The provided template was extremely useful, and I will happily use it in my future projects. It allowed me to conduct a thorough evaluation of the problem and come up with a well-rounded solution.
